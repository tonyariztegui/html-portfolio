  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello everyone! My name is Tony, and I currently live in Italy. I have a diverse set of interests and roles. I work as a French tutor, have experience in customer service, and I'm also venturing into the exciting world of web development (fingers crossed for success!).</p>

  <p>For almost a decade, I've been involved in customer service, starting from my humble beginnings as a waiter and eventually working my way up to becoming a Team Leader for a multinational company. I genuinely enjoy working in customer service because it allows me to help others, build relationships, and tackle problem-solving challenges. It's truly fulfilling to provide exceptional solutions that meet both customer needs and company goals.</p>

  <p>In the past couple of years, I've been working as a French tutor, assisting several secondary schools in Italy with the DELF language certification project at the A2 level. This new experience has quickly become a passion of mine. I love sharing knowledge, seeing my students make progress, and witnessing the positive outcomes of our collaborative efforts.</p>

  <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited to pursue another interest of mine: web development. I find the field incredibly fascinating and full of endless possibilities. Additionally, as a fan of video games, I'm eager to explore the realm of building interactive games that not only entertain but also serve as effective tools for language learning.</p>

  <p>In summary, I'm an individual driven by a desire to make a positive impact. Whether it's through customer service, teaching French, or delving into web development, I approach each endeavor with enthusiasm and a friendly attitude.</p>
